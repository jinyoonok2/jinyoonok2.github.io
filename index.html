                <h4>Jinyoon Kim</h4>
                <p>I completed my bachelor of science in Computer Science at Pennsylvania State University Harrisburg in 2024. My research interests include enhancing and developing 3D object detection in machine perception and vision language models to help models fluently understand the contents of the world through computer vision, enabling interaction with humans or the environment to perform tasks. Currently, I am working on deep learning neural networks that help autonomous agents safely navigate through space by providing 3D visualizations of their surroundings, generated from real-time video or image input. Before graduation, I worked on various research projects related to image recognition for medical image analysis, as well as automated self-supervised learning systems, and published the results under the supervision of my mentors.</p>
